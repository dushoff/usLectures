Vitamin A \chinese{登革熱}

	We compare health indicators of children treated or not treated with
	vitamin A supplements 

		\emph{Estimate:} how much taller (or shorter) are the treated
		children on average?

		\emph{Confirmation:} are we sure that the supplements are helping
		(or hurting)?

		\emph{Range of estimates:} how much do we think the supplement is
		helping?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

TSS P values and confidence intervals

	We use \emph{P values} to say how sure we are that we have seen a
	positive effect

	We use \emph{confidence intervals} to say what we think is going on
	(with a certain level of confidence)

	P values are \emph{over-rated}

	\emph{Never} use a high P value as (direct) evidence for anything,
	e.g.:
	
		that an effect is small

		that two quantities are similar

	What does a P value actually measure?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Vitamin A example

	We want to know if vitamin A supplements improve the health of
	village children

		Is height a good measure of general health?

		How will we know height differences are due to our treatment?

			ANS We want the two groups to start from the same point --
			independent randomization of each individual

			ANS We may measure \emph{changes} in height

			ANS Or \emph{control for} height (and maybe other factors)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

What do we hope to learn?

	Is vitamin A good for these children?

	How sure are we?

	How good do we think it is?

	How sure are we about that?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

P values

	Activity: What is a P value?

	What does it mean if I find a “significant P value” for some effect
	in this experiment?

	ANS The difference is unlikely to be due to chance

		ANS So what!  I already know vitamin A has strong effects on
		metabolism

	If I'm certain that the true answer isn't exactly zero, why do I
	want the P value anyway?

	ANS Clarity!

	ANS We should call it that

		ANS Instead of significance

----------------------------------------------------------------------


Types of Error

	Type I (\emph{False positive:}) concluding there is an effect when
	there isn't one

		This doesn't happen in biology.  There is always an effect.

	Type II (\emph{False negative:}) concluding there is no effect when
	there really is

		This \emph{should} never happen, because we should never conclude
		there is no effect

----------------------------------------------------------------------

RHEAD Types of Error

	Type Zero is the error of using numerical codes for things that have perfectly good simple names

	Just say ``false positive'' or ``false negative'' when possible

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Experimental design

	\emph{False positive:} in the \emph{hypothetical} case that the
	effect is exactly zero, what is the probability of falsely finding
	an effect?

		Should be less than or equal to my significance value

	\emph{False negative:} what is the probability of failing
	to find an effect that is there?

		Requires you specify a hypothetical effect \emph{size}

		This is a \emph{scientific} judgment

	These are useful to analyze \textbf{power} and \textbf{validity} of a
	statistical design
	
		You should do these analyses \emph{before} you collect data

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Doing Science

	Once you collect data:

	You should never make a false-negative error.

		ANS Never accept the null

	Or a false-positive error

		ANS If you never believe the null is exactly true, the idea of a false
		positive doesn't make sense

	\emph{Sign \chinese{($\pm$)} error:}
	if I think an effect is positive, when it's really
	negative (or vice versa)

	\emph{Magnitude \chinese{(大小)} error:} if I think an effect is small, when
	it's really large (or vice versa)

	Confidence intervals aid clear thinking

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Low P values

BC

	If I have a low P value I can see something clearly

	But it's usually better to focus on what I see than the P value

NC

SIDEFIG webpix/clear.jpg

EC


----------------------------------------------------------------------

High P values

BC

	If I have a high P value, there is something I \emph{don't} see
	clearly

	It \emph{may be} because this effect is small

	High P values should \emph{not} be used to advance \emph{any}
	scientific conclusion

NC

SIDEFIG webpix/fog.jpg

EC

----------------------------------------------------------------------

What causes high P values?

	Small differences

	Less data

	More noise

	An inappropriate model

	Less model resolution

	A lower P value means that your evidence for difference is better

	A higher P value means that your evidence for similarity is
	better -- or worse!

NONCTS Misleading language

	Null effects of boot camps

		ANS Not really a thing.

	Fat storage in vole populations is not correlated with elevation

		ANS Yes, it is!

	As expected, the placebo group did not differ significantly from the
	control group

		ANS Why would that be good?

	B and B showed that there is no statistically significant difference
	in sexual risk behaviour between men with and without clinic
	access in Zambia

		ANS No, they didn't

		ANS Statistical significance is a property of the \emph{study}
		(and the sample population), never of real groups (or the
		idealized population)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

NONCTS Another way to talk

	Unclear effects of boot camps

		ANS They really want to say “small” effects, but that would require a
		different test!

	As expected, the sign of the difference between the placebo group and
	controls was unclear

		ANS Is this convincing? Will it remind people to check the size of
		difference?

	The direction of correlation between fat storage and elevation in
	vole populations is unclear in this study

	B and B showed that there is an unclear difference in sexual risk
	behaviour between men with and without clinic access in Zambia

		ANS Now obviously weird. So you have to say it better

		bad logic in service of conclusions that are (usually) correct

	This sort of statistical practice leads in the aggregate to bad

	The logic can be fixed:

		Estimate a difference, or an interaction

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Small effects

	We can't build statistical confidence that something is small by
	failing to see it clearly

	We must instead see clearly that it is small

	This means we need a standard (our cutoff) for what we mean by small

Flu mask example

	People who work in respiratory clinics sometimes have to wear bulky,
	uncomfortable, expensive masks

	They would like to switch to simpler masks, if those will do the job

	How can this be tested statistically?  We don't want the masks to be
	“different”.

		We need to decide what we mean by different in this case!

		They're not the same, so how close is close enough?

SEC Paradigms for inference

----------------------------------------------------------------------

TSS Frequentist paradigm

	Make a null model

	Test whether the effect you see could be due to chance

		What is the probability of seeing a difference of exactly 0.0048 in
		proportional growth?

			ANS Zero!

	Test whether the effect you see {\em or a larger effect} could be
	due to chance

		This probability is the (frequentist) P value

	JD: It's actually better to calculate a one-sided P value. You would then
	usually double this to get a standard P value

NC

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Bayesian inference

	We want to go from a \emph{statistical model} of how our data are
	generated, to a probability model of parameter values

		Requires \emph{prior} distributions:
		
			the assumed likelihood of parameters before these observations are
			made

		Use Bayes theorem to calculate \emph{posterior} distributions:

			the inferred likelihood of parameters after taking the data into
			account

	Provides a strong framework for combining information from different sources
	and for propagating uncertainty

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Bayesian P value

	Once you make strong-enough assumptions, the Bayesian framework allows you
	to calculate true probabilities

		Meaning, they are really probabilities; they are only as “true” as your
		assumptions

	A natural approach to Bayesian P values is simply the probability that your
	estimate has the wrong sign

		Often better to double this value, to align with frequentist tradition

BAYESCALC Example: MMEV 

	MMEV is a viral infection that can cause a serious disease
	(called MMED)
	
	LIT MMED patients are unable to control their urge to fit models to data

	The rapid MMEV test gives a positive result:

		100% of the time for people with the virus
		
		5% of the time for people without the virus

----------------------------------------------------------------------

MMED MMEV questions

	The rapid MMEV test gives a positive result:

		100% of the time for people with the virus
		
		5% of the time for people without the virus

	The population prevalence of MMEV is 1% 

	You test a \emph{random} person from this population, and
	the result is positive.

		What is the probability that they have MMEV?

	This calculation is the core of Bayes \emph{theorem}

----------------------------------------------------------------------

MMED MMEV questions

	You learn that your friend has had a positive rapid test for MMEV

		What do you tell them? 

			ANS You don't tell them \emph{anything} until you ask them some
			questions!

	Bayesian inference:

		Clear conclusions

		based on clear (and often strong) assumptions

		Need to be clear about the assumptions you are making

TSEC Philosophy of fitting

	Principled statistical fitting is hard

	A big advantage of having good computers is that you can \emph{test} fitting
	approaches on simple and complicated model worlds before applying them to
	real data

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Approximating probabilities

	In both paradigms, we want to calculate true probabilities to reinforce our
	conclusions

	In most complicated situations (e.g., dynamical model fits), these
	probabilities cannot be calculated directly

	We approximate the probabilities we want using likelihoods 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

NEWLIKE Likelihoods

	What we want to know is [frequentist or Bayesian] probabilities relating to our \emph{parameters} based on the data

		Is $\Ro<2$; Is $\bar D < 6d$?

	What we can easily calculate based on assumptions is the likelihood of our \emph{data} based on the parameters.

		Proportional to probability of seeing the data

		But probability of seeing these exact data is hard to define, and not
		very interesting

----------------------------------------------------------------------

NEWLIKE Algorithms

	If we can calculate likelihoods, we have good algorithms to estimate the probabilities that we want

		For frequentist tests, we use maximum likelihood estimation

		For Bayesian tests, we use MCMC

----------------------------------------------------------------------

NEWLIKE Normal likelihoods

	Assume that the difference between the estimate $\hat y_i$ and the
	data point $y_i$ is normally distributed.  What is the log
	likelihood?

	$$L = \prod_i{\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}\exp\left(\frac{-(
	y_i-\hat y_i)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)}$$

	$$\ell = \sum_i{-\log(\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}) - \sum_i{\frac{(
	y_i-\hat y_i)^2}{2\sigma^2}}}$$

	\emph{We maximize the likelihood by minimizing the sum of squares}

		and then solving for $\sigma$

----------------------------------------------------------------------

NEWLIKE Least squares $\to$ likelihood

	Attaching your least squares fit to a likelihood means:

		You can \emph{use it} for statistical inference (likelihood ratio test)

		You can \emph{challenge} the assumptions

----------------------------------------------------------------------

NEWLIKE Other distributions

	Maybe we want a lognormal distribution of titres

		Dr.~Rong did that: least squares on the log scale!

	Maybe we want a Poisson (or negative binomial) distribution for counts

	Maybe we want a binomial (or beta binomial) distribution for samples

	It's better to be explicit about what distribution you are assuming!

----------------------------------------------------------------------

SEC Conclusion

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Your philosophy

	Statistics are not a magic machine that gives you the right answer

	If you are to be a serious scientist in a noisy world, you should
	have your own philosophy of statistics

		Be pragmatic: your goal is to do science, not get caught by
		theoretical considerations

		Be honest: it's harder than it sounds.  

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Honesty

	You can always keep analyzing until you find a ``significant''
	result

		If you do this you will make a lot of mistakes

	You may also keep analyzing until you find a result that you already
	believe is true. 

		This is \emph{confirmation bias;} you're probably right, but your project
		is not advancing science

	Good practice

		Make an analysis plan before you start

		If flexibility is allowed in your context: 

			keep an analysis journal as you go

Summary

	P values are over-rated

		and often misunderstand

	High P values should not be used as evidence for anything ever.

		They can provide indirect evidence. Wonderful. Find the direct
		evidence and use that instead.

	Effect sizes and confidence intervals are almost always better

	Use the right P value (or confidence interval) for your question
	
		Non-inferiority tests, interactions

----------------------------------------------------------------------

RHEAD Summary

	Frequentist statistics makes weak assumptions, and finds logically weak
	formal conclusions:

		These parameters are unlikely to produce a statistic this extreme by
		chance

	Bayesian statistics makes strong assumptions:
	
		prior distributions must be fully specified
		
	\ldots and finds logically strong 
	formal conclusions:

		The probability that the effect value is in this range is X

		These strong conclusions can be used directly for prediction with
		uncertainty

----------------------------------------------------------------------

RHEAD Summary

	Statistics are a key component of data-based science

		You should think about statistical analysis from the beginning of
		your project

	You need a basic understanding of statistical principles

	You need your own statistical philosophy

		If you're a theoretician, it should be ideological and honest

		If you're a scientist, it should be pragmatic and honest
